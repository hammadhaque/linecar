Project Title
One Paragraph of project description goes here

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
With regards to software the only thing that will be needed is the Code Composer Studio IDE that I will explain how to install in the installing tab.
With regards to the hardware components: 2 tcrt5000 sensors, 1 msp430g2553, resistors varying from 220 ohm to 10 kohms, plenty of wire
                                         A car with 5v motors and a power supply, usb cable.
                                         
Give examples
Installing
In order to properly run and test the code a version of Code Composer Studio (CCS) by texas instruments will be needed to be installed on yor computer. This IDE will allow you to work with all variants of the msp430. A link for information on installing CCS can be found here: http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Compiler_Installation_and_Selection. 

Say what the step will be

Give the example
And repeat

until finished
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example
And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example
